    <p>
      &ldquo;Syllabus&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the official term, but it&rsquo;s what most students mean
      when they ask what Step 3 actually covers. The real document is the USMLE Step 3 Content
      Outline and Specifications, published directly by the NBME and FSMB, and it breaks the
      multiple-choice portion of the exam down two different ways at once: by organ system and by
      physician task. This guide walks through both, with the exact percentage ranges from the
      official outline.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.whatItIs} />
    <p>
      Every Step 3 multiple-choice question is tagged along two separate axes simultaneously: a{' '}
      <strong>system</strong> (which organ system or process the question is about) and a{' '}
      <strong>physician task</strong> (what kind of reasoning it&rsquo;s testing, like diagnosis
      versus management). The content outline covers both Day 1 (Foundations of Independent
      Practice) and Day 2 (Advanced Clinical Medicine) MCQ sessions combined; it does not assign a
      published percentage to the separate CCS case simulations on Day 2, which is covered
      separately below.
    </p>
    <Callout title="The percentages in each table do not need to add up with each other" tone="disclosure">
      <p>
        Systems sum to roughly 100% on their own, and physician tasks sum to roughly 100% on their
        own, because they are two separate ways of slicing the same multiple-choice question pool,
        not two different question pools. Do not try to add a system percentage to a physician
        task percentage.
      </p>
    </Callout>

    <H2 section={S.systems} />
    <p>
      The system breakdown tells you which organ systems and processes get the most questions
      across both MCQ sessions, regardless of what kind of reasoning each question is testing.

      The physician task breakdown tells you what kind of thinking a question is actually asking
      you to do, and it looks very different from Step 1 and Step 2 CK: diagnosis and management
      together make up roughly two-thirds of the exam.

    <H2 section={S.ccs} />
    <p>
      Day 2 of Step 3 also includes Computer-based Case Simulations (CCS), where you manage a
      simulated patient in real time instead of answering discrete multiple-choice items. The
      official content outline does not publish a percentage weighting for CCS the way it does for
      systems and physician tasks; it only lists which systems the case simulations draw from,
      without an associated range. Budget dedicated CCS practice time separately from your
      MCQ-focused review, since the breakdown above doesn&rsquo;t capture it.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.meaning} />
    <p>
      Three things stand out once you see the actual numbers instead of guessing at them.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3 is management-heavy, not knowledge-recall-heavy.</strong> Diagnosis and
        management together make up roughly two-thirds of the exam, while applying foundational
        science concepts drops to just 11 to 13%, a near-total reversal from Step 1&rsquo;s 60 to
        70%. Practice questions that ask &ldquo;what do you do next,&rdquo; not just &ldquo;what is
        the diagnosis,&rdquo; deserve the bulk of your review time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No single organ system dominates.</strong> The highest system category,
        Biostatistics &amp; Epidemiology, tops out at 13%, and the spread across the remaining
        thirteen system categories is relatively flat. Skipping an entire system is a riskier bet
        than skipping depth in any single smaller category.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>CCS needs its own study block.</strong> Because it carries no published percentage
        weighting, it&rsquo;s easy to under-allocate time to it. Treat case simulation practice as a
        separate line item in your schedule, not something you&rsquo;ll pick up automatically from
        MCQ review.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you want a week-by-week plan that actually reflects this weighting, our{' '}
      <Link href="/blog/usmle-step-3-study-guide">Step 3 study guide</Link> includes a sample
      schedule, and our{' '}
      <Link href="/blog/usmle-step-3-exam-dates-2026">Step 3 exam dates guide</Link> covers
      scheduling and registration logistics that the content outline does not.

    <H2 section={S.faq} />
    <h3>Is "content outline" the same thing as "syllabus"?</h3>
    <p>
      Close enough for practical purposes. USMLE&rsquo;s own term is the Content Outline and
      Specifications, published by the NBME and FSMB. Most students just call it the syllabus or
      the blueprint.
    </p>
    <h3>Why do the percentages in different tables not add up to 100% together?</h3>
    <p>
      Because systems and physician tasks are two separate, overlapping ways of classifying the
      same set of multiple-choice questions, not two different sets of questions. Each table sums
      to roughly 100% on its own.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the single most heavily tested system on Step 3?</h3>
    <p>
      Biostatistics &amp; Epidemiology/Population Health &amp; Interpretation of the Medical
      Literature, at 11 to 13%, though the spread across systems is relatively flat, so no single
      system dominates the way diagnosis and management dominate the physician task axis.
    </p>
    <h3>Does the content outline tell you how much CCS is worth?</h3>
    <p>
      No. The official outline lists which systems the case simulations cover but does not publish
      a percentage weighting for CCS, unlike the systems and physician task tables above.
    </p>
    <h3>How is this different from the Step 1 and Step 2 CK syllabus?</h3>
    <p>
      Step 3 drops Step 1&rsquo;s discipline axis and Step 2 CK&rsquo;s clinical science axis
      entirely, leaving only systems and physician tasks. The task axis also shifts dramatically:
      Diagnosis and Management together make up roughly two-thirds of Step 3, compared to 20 to 25%
      for diagnosis alone on Step 1. See our{' '}
      <Link href="/blog/usmle-step-1-syllabus">Step 1 syllabus guide</Link> and{' '}
      <Link href="/blog/usmle-step-2-ck-syllabus">Step 2 CK syllabus guide</Link> for the full
      comparison.
    </p>
    <h3>Does the content outline ever change?</h3>
    <p>
      The NBME and FSMB can update it, so treat the figures here as a snapshot and confirm the
      current outline directly on USMLE.org before building a study plan around exact percentages.
