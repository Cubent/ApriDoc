    <p>
      &ldquo;Syllabus&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the official term, but it&rsquo;s what most students mean
      when they ask what Step 2 CK actually covers. The real document is the USMLE Step 2 CK
      Content Outline, published directly by the NBME and FSMB, and it breaks the exam down three
      different ways at once: by content area, by clinical science (rotation), and by physician
      task. This guide walks through all three, with the exact percentage ranges from the official
      outline.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.whatItIs} />
    <p>
      Every Step 2 CK question is tagged along three separate axes simultaneously: a{' '}
      <strong>content area</strong> (an organ system or a cross-cutting area like Nutrition or
      Social Sciences), a <strong>clinical science</strong> (which core rotation the scenario comes
      from), and a <strong>physician task</strong> (what kind of clinical reasoning or management
      decision it&rsquo;s testing). A single question about managing a patient with new atrial
      fibrillation could count toward the cardiovascular system, Medicine as a clinical science,
      and pharmacotherapy as a physician task, all at once.
    </p>
    <Callout title="The percentages in each table do not need to add up with each other" tone="disclosure">
      <p>
        Content areas sum to roughly 100% on their own, clinical sciences sum to roughly 100% on
        their own, and physician tasks sum to roughly 100% on their own, because they are three
        separate, overlapping ways of classifying the same question pool, not three different
        question pools. Do not try to add a content area percentage to a clinical science
        percentage.
      </p>
    </Callout>

    <H2 section={S.systems} />
    <p>
      The content area breakdown tells you which organ systems and cross-cutting areas get the
      most questions, regardless of which rotation the scenario is drawn from.

    <H2 section={S.tasks} />
    <p>
      The physician task breakdown tells you what kind of clinical decision a question is actually
      asking you to make, separate from the subject matter or rotation entirely. Step 2 CK&rsquo;s
      task list is far more granular than Step 1&rsquo;s, reflecting its heavier emphasis on
      patient management.

    <H2 section={S.meaning} />
    <p>
      Three things stand out once you see the actual numbers instead of guessing at them.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Medicine dominates the clinical science axis.</strong> At 55 to 65%, internal
        medicine-style reasoning underlies well over half the exam, regardless of which content
        area a given question is attached to. If your review time is limited, depth in medicine
        pays off more than depth in any single other rotation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No single content area dominates the way Medicine dominates clinical sciences.</strong>{' '}
        The highest content area, Nutrition, tops out at 20%, and the spread across content areas
        is much flatter than the spread across clinical sciences. Skipping an entire rotation like
        Surgery or Psychiatry is a riskier bet than skipping depth in a smaller content area.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Diagnosis and data interpretation outweigh pure management.</strong> Patient Care:
        Diagnosis and Laboratory/Diagnostic Studies together can account for close to a third of
        the exam, ahead of Mixed Management and Pharmacotherapy combined. Knowing the next
        diagnostic step matters at least as much as knowing the treatment.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <H2 section={S.faq} />
    <h3>Is "content outline" the same thing as "syllabus"?</h3>
    <p>
      Close enough for practical purposes. USMLE&rsquo;s own term is the Content Outline and
      Specifications, published by the NBME and FSMB. Most students just call it the syllabus or
      the blueprint.
    </p>
    <h3>Why do the percentages in different tables not add up to 100% together?</h3>
    <p>
      Because content areas, clinical sciences and physician tasks are three separate, overlapping
      ways of classifying the same set of questions, not three different sets of questions. Each
      table sums to roughly 100% on its own.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the single most heavily tested clinical science on Step 2 CK?</h3>
    <p>
      Medicine, at 55 to 65% of the exam, by a wide margin over Pediatrics, Obstetrics &amp;
      Gynecology, Psychiatry and Surgery.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the single most heavily tested content area on Step 2 CK?</h3>
    <p>
      Nutrition, at 15 to 20%, though the spread across content areas is much flatter than the
      spread across clinical sciences, so no single area dominates the way Medicine does.
    </p>
    <h3>How is this different from the Step 1 syllabus?</h3>
    <p>
      Step 2 CK replaces Step 1&rsquo;s discipline axis (Pathology, Physiology, Pharmacology, and
      so on) with a clinical science axis organized by rotation (Medicine, Pediatrics, OB/GYN,
      Psychiatry, Surgery), and its physician task list is far more granular, split across ten
      specific patient-care categories instead of Step 1&rsquo;s four. See our{' '}
      <Link href="/blog/usmle-step-1-syllabus">Step 1 syllabus guide</Link> for that breakdown.
    </p>
    <h3>What about the Step 3 syllabus?</h3>
    <p>
      See our <Link href="/blog/usmle-step-3-syllabus">Step 3 syllabus guide</Link> for the same
      breakdown applied to Step 3, which drops the clinical science axis entirely and shifts
      heavily toward diagnosis and management instead of foundational science.
    </p>
    <h3>Does the content outline ever change?</h3>
    <p>
      The NBME and FSMB can update it, so treat the figures here as a snapshot and confirm the
      current outline directly on USMLE.org before building a study plan around exact percentages.
