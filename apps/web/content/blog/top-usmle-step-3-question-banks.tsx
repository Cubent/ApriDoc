      MedPrep Institute is the question bank we build. Instead of a static set of Step 3
      vignettes, an adaptive engine flags the concept behind every question you miss and brings
      you variations on it through spaced repetition. If you used MedPrep for Step 1 or Step 2 CK,
      your progress carries over automatically into Step 3.

    <h3>What you get for Step 3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>NBME-style patient management vignettes across every clinical discipline.</li>
      <li>An adaptive engine that targets your weak disciplines instead of moving on after one attempt.</li>

      <li>{MEDPREP_STEP3_TOPICS} Step 3 question topics, each producing a full clinical vignette when you reach it.</li>

    <h3>Who it suits for Step 3, and where to add something</h3>
    <p>
      MedPrep suits residents who need multiple-choice practice that fits around shift work and
      resurfaces weak concepts automatically. It does not include CCS case simulations, so pair it
      with UWorld or another dedicated CCS resource for day two of the exam, and with the official
      NBME self-assessments to check readiness.

    />

    <H2 section={S.uworld} />
    <p>
      UWorld is the only bank in this comparison with confirmed CCS case simulations, 90+ of them,
      alongside 2,100+ multiple-choice questions. That is the single biggest differentiator for
      Step 3 specifically, since day two of the real exam is CCS, not just more multiple-choice
      questions.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths for Step 3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>90+ CCS case simulations, unmatched by any other bank we checked.</li>
      <li>2,100+ multiple-choice questions for day one and the MCQ portion of day two.</li>
      <li>Two official self-assessments included on every plan, regardless of length.</li>
      <li>An optional QBank Plus tier that adds medical videos for $99 more.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Drawbacks for Step 3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The most expensive Step 3 bank with published pricing: $449 for 90 days, against $169 for BoardVitals&rsquo; 90-day Prepare plan.</li>
      <li>No confirmed free trial on the official page we checked.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Which plan to buy for Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Since both self-assessments are included on every plan length, the deciding factor is
      runway, not features. A 90-day plan ($449) covers a typical residency study block; if your
      schedule means you will realistically need more than three months of access around shift
      work, the 180-day plan ($499) adds three more months for only $50 more.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.amboss} />
    <p>
      AMBOSS does not sell a separate Step 3 product. Step 3 questions are covered under the same
      USMLE plan that includes Step 1 and Step 2 CK content, drawn from its 5,800+ Step question
      Qbank.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths for Step 3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>One subscription covers Step 1, Step 2 CK and Step 3 multiple-choice practice together.</li>
      <li>A library and score predictor included on every plan.</li>
      <li>A confirmed 5-day free trial and 30-day money-back guarantee on direct purchases.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Drawbacks for Step 3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No CCS case simulations, since AMBOSS&rsquo;s Step 3 coverage is multiple-choice only.</li>
      <li>No Step 3-specific question count published, since it is part of the combined Qbank figure.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Which plan to buy for Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      If you already have an active AMBOSS subscription from Step 1 or Step 2 CK, it already
      covers Step 3 multiple-choice practice at no extra cost. If you are starting fresh for Step
      3 only, the 6-month plan ($378) is a reasonable supplementary purchase alongside a
      CCS-capable bank like UWorld.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.boardvitals} />
    <p>
      BoardVitals sells the same three-tier structure for Step 3 that it uses for Step 1: Cram (1
      month), Prepare (3 months) and Master (6 months), with 1,500+ questions and no CCS practice.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths for Step 3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The lowest published prices in this comparison: $109 to $249 depending on tier.</li>
      <li>A 100% pass guarantee on the Prepare and Master tiers.</li>
      <li>A genuine 1-month option for residents very close to their test date.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Drawbacks for Step 3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No CCS case simulations at all, so it cannot be a standalone Step 3 prep tool.</li>
      <li>The smallest confirmed multiple-choice bank in this comparison at 1,500+ questions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Which plan to buy for Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      BoardVitals works best as budget multiple-choice volume paired with a dedicated CCS
      resource, not as your only Step 3 bank. The Prepare tier (3 months, $169) is the cheapest
      option that still carries the pass guarantee.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.kaplan} />
    <p>
      Kaplan sells a Step 3 Qbank with free sample questions, positioned in third-party reviews as
      a budget option, though we could not confirm pricing or question counts ourselves: its
      pricing pages returned an access error every time we tried to load them directly. Check{' '}
      <External href="https://www.kaptest.com/">kaptest.com</External> directly if you are
      considering it.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.noStep3} />
    <p>
      TrueLearn, Lecturio and USMLE-Rx each sell question banks for Step 1 and, in TrueLearn&rsquo;s
      case, Step 2 CK and shelf exams, but none of their official pages we checked list a Step 3
      product. If you are using one of these for Step 1 or Step 2 CK, plan on a different bank for
      Step 3 rather than assuming the same subscription will carry over.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.choose} />
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>You need CCS practice:</strong> UWorld. It is the only bank here with confirmed
        case simulations, and CCS is half of day two of the real exam.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>You already have AMBOSS from Step 1 or Step 2 CK:</strong> your subscription
        already covers Step 3 multiple-choice questions at no extra cost. Pair it with UWorld or
        another CCS resource.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Your budget is tight:</strong> BoardVitals&rsquo; Prepare tier ($169 for 3 months),
        paired with a separate CCS resource.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>You want extra multiple-choice volume that fits around resident shifts:</strong>{' '}
        MedPrep, for five-question sets and adaptive review.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>You were using TrueLearn, Lecturio or USMLE-Rx for earlier Steps:</strong> plan on
        switching banks for Step 3, since none of them list a Step 3 product.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <H2 section={S.perDay} />
    <p>
      Step 3&rsquo;s two-day, two-part format changes how volume should work compared to Step 1 or
      Step 2 CK. Day one is multiple-choice only; day two mixes multiple-choice with CCS cases.
      Split your practice to match: dedicate most sessions to multiple-choice questions, since that
      is most of the exam, but do not skip CCS practice entirely in the weeks before your test
      date, since it is a real, substantial part of day two that multiple-choice drilling alone
      will not prepare you for.
    </p>
    <Callout title="A small daily habit beats an ambitious one you cannot sustain" tone="disclosure">
      <p>
        Residency schedules are far less predictable than a student&rsquo;s. Five real questions
        answered and reviewed properly beats forty skipped ones on a bad call day.

    <H2 section={S.start} />
    <p>
      Most residents take Step 3 during PGY-1, often within a window set by their state medical
      board or residency program, and a true dedicated study block is not guaranteed the way it
      was for Step 1 or Step 2 CK. Build a small daily habit early rather than waiting for a
      dedicated period that may not come, and treat any protected study time your program does
      give you as a bonus for final review and CCS practice, not your primary study window.

    <h3>What is the single best question bank for USMLE Step 3?</h3>
    <p>
      UWorld, because it is the only bank we checked with confirmed CCS case simulations alongside
      2,100+ multiple-choice questions. If you already have AMBOSS from an earlier Step, it covers
      Step 3 multiple-choice practice at no extra cost, but you will still need a separate CCS
      resource.
    </p>
    <h3>Do TrueLearn, Lecturio or USMLE-Rx cover Step 3?</h3>
    <p>
      No. None of their official pages we checked list a Step 3 product. If you used one of them
      for Step 1 or Step 2 CK, plan on a different bank for Step 3.
    </p>
    <h3>Do I need a bank with CCS cases, or can I use multiple-choice only?</h3>
    <p>
      CCS is a real, substantial part of day two of the real exam, so multiple-choice practice
      alone will leave a genuine gap. UWorld is the only bank in this comparison with confirmed
      CCS content; everyone else here covers multiple-choice only.
    </p>
    <h3>When during residency should I take Step 3?</h3>
    <p>
      Most residents take it during PGY-1, often within a window set by their state medical board
      or residency program. Confirm your own program&rsquo;s timeline and your state&rsquo;s
      requirements early, since they vary.
