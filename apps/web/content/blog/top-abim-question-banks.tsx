      MedPrep Institute is the question bank we build, and it works differently from every fixed,
      pre-written bank below: instead of a static set of questions you work through once, an
      adaptive engine flags the concept behind every question you miss and brings you variations
      on it through spaced repetition over the following days. If you used MedPrep for the USMLE
      Steps, your progress carries over automatically into ABIM prep.

      <li>Board-style internal medicine vignettes across every clinical discipline on the blueprint.</li>
      <li>An adaptive engine that targets your weak disciplines instead of moving on after one attempt.</li>

    <h3>Who it suits for ABIM, and where to add something</h3>
    <p>
      MedPrep suits residents and early-career internists who keep missing the same concepts and
      want reviews scheduled for them automatically instead of planning them by hand. It does not
      include an official-style self-assessment exam or a score predictor. Pair it with UWorld&rsquo;s
      self-assessment forms or MKSAP&rsquo;s own self-assessment questions for that piece.

    <H2 section={S.uworld} />
    <p>
      UWorld has become the newer default choice for ABIM prep among residents, with 1,200+
      questions in the main QBank (1,816 across all of its ABIM products) and the same detailed,
      visual explanation style it is known for on the USMLE Steps.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths for ABIM</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A modern, detailed explanation style many residents already know from Step prep.</li>
      <li>An optional Medical Library add-on with 1,300+ articles for an extra $50 on every plan.</li>
      <li>A Study Planner and one-time reset included on plans of 180 days or longer.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Drawbacks for ABIM</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The highest entry price among banks with published pricing: $499 for 90 days, against
        $140 for TrueLearn&rsquo;s 30-day plan and $209 for BoardVitals&rsquo; 1-month Cram tier.
      </li>
      <li>Self-assessment forms are sold separately at $50 each, or $120 for all three, not bundled into any plan.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Which plan to buy for ABIM</h3>
    <p>
      Since self-assessments cost extra regardless of plan length, the deciding factor is runway.
      The 90-day plan ($499) covers a standard review block; if you are spreading review across
      your final year of residency rather than a short dedicated period, the 360-day plan ($599)
      adds nine more months for only $100 more than the 90-day plan.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.mksap} />
    <p>
      MKSAP, published by the American College of Physicians, is the traditional standard for
      ABIM prep: a full text review and Board Basics study guide bundled with almost 2,000
      questions, not a standalone Qbank.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths for ABIM</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A complete review program, not just questions: full text chapters, Board Basics, and image-based Virtual Dx questions.</li>
      <li>Nearly 2,000 adaptive digital flashcards included alongside the question bank.</li>
      <li>Resident member pricing ($415 for 1 year) is competitive with other banks once the full program is counted.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Drawbacks for ABIM</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Nonmember pricing is the highest in this comparison: $849 for 1 year, $1,275 for 3 years.</li>
      <li>No free trial confirmed on the official page we checked.</li>
      <li>All-digital only: the standalone print edition (MKSAP 19) is no longer available as of August 2026.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Which plan to buy for ABIM</h3>
    <p>
      If you are an ACP resident member, the 1-year resident rate ($415) is the clear default and
      among the cheapest options in this entire comparison. If you are not yet an ACP member,
      compare the cost of joining ACP against the nonmember price difference before paying the
      full $849.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.amboss} />
    <p>
      AMBOSS Knowledge+ Internal Medicine Board Review bundles 2,000+ questions with its clinical
      library and two full-length, 60-question practice exams, inside the same kind of
      subscription AMBOSS sells for the USMLE Steps.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths for ABIM</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2,000+ questions plus a 1,500+ article clinical library included on every plan.</li>
      <li>Two full-length practice exams included, not sold as a separate add-on.</li>
      <li>A confirmed 5-day free trial and 30-day money-back guarantee on direct purchases.</li>
      <li>Automatic ABIM MOC point transmission and AMA PRA Category 1 Credit on completed content.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Drawbacks for ABIM</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No score predictor confirmed for the Internal Medicine board review product specifically.</li>
      <li>The cheapest plan still bundles a full year of library access, which you may not need if you only want the Qbank.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Which plan to buy for ABIM</h3>
    <p>
      The entry plan (1 month of Qbank access plus 1 year of library access, $298) is the cheapest
      way to get the full practice-exam bundle. If you want Qbank access for longer than a month,
      the 6-month plan ($378) adds five more months of Qbank access for $80 more.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.truelearn} />
    <p>
      TrueLearn has the lowest short-term entry price of any confirmed ABIM bank in this
      comparison, with 1,800+ questions and the same national-benchmarking analytics it uses
      across its other SmartBanks.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths for ABIM</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The lowest published short-term price here: $140 for 30 days.</li>
      <li>A pass guarantee specifically for the ABIM Board Exam.</li>
      <li>Performance analytics with national benchmarking against other test takers.</li>
      <li>A 5-day free trial, and purchased access can wait up to 365 days before you activate it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Drawbacks for ABIM</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A smaller confirmed question count than AMBOSS or UWorld&rsquo;s combined ABIM products.</li>
      <li>No bundled text review or library the way MKSAP or AMBOSS include.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Which plan to buy for ABIM</h3>
    <p>
      If you are spreading review across most of your final year, the 365-day plan ($310) works
      out to less than a dollar a day and is cheaper overall than UWorld&rsquo;s 360-day plan
      ($599). For a short, compressed timeline close to your test date, the 90-day plan ($200)
      still carries the pass guarantee.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.boardvitals} />
    <p>
      BoardVitals sells the same three-tier structure for ABIM that it uses across its other board
      review products, Cram (1 month), Prepare (3 months) and Master (6 months), with 1,650+
      questions.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths for ABIM</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A 100% pass guarantee on the Prepare and Master tiers.</li>
      <li>A free trial with no card required, to sample the question style before paying anything.</li>
      <li>An optional CME certificate add-on, discounted for Master and Prepare subscribers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Drawbacks for ABIM</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The smallest confirmed question count among the guarantee-backed options in this comparison.</li>
      <li>Full-length practice exams are a paid add-on ($25, or $20 with Master/Prepare) rather than included.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Which plan to buy for ABIM</h3>
    <p>
      The Prepare tier (3 months, $319) is the cheapest option that still carries the pass
      guarantee. The Master tier (6 months, $549) only makes sense if you genuinely need six
      months of access, since it costs more than UWorld&rsquo;s 360-day plan for less total runway.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.choose} />
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>You are an ACP resident member:</strong> MKSAP&rsquo;s resident rate ($415 for 1

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>You keep missing the same concepts no matter which bank you use:</strong> add
        MedPrep&rsquo;s adaptive review alongside your primary bank.

    </ul>

    <H2 section={S.perDay} />
    <p>
      There is no single right number for ABIM. Early in your final year, a small daily set mixed
      across disciplines works well, since clinical rotations are already covering a real share of
      the blueprint. As your test date approaches, move toward timed, mixed blocks that mirror the
      actual exam&rsquo;s four-session format.
    </p>
    <Callout title="Clinical experience already covers part of the blueprint" tone="disclosure">
      <p>
        Unlike Step 1, you are not learning internal medicine for the first time. Question
        practice works best alongside your clinical experience, consolidating it into exam form,
        not replacing it.
      </p>
    </Callout>

    <H2 section={S.start} />
    <p>
      Since ABIM is offered only once a year, registration deadlines and study time both need to
      be planned earlier than you would for a USMLE Step. Most residents spread review across
      their final year rather than cramming into a short block at the end, and save official
      self-assessments for the final two to three weeks, when a score actually predicts readiness.

    <H2 section={S.faq} />
    <h3>What is the single best question bank for the ABIM exam?</h3>
    <p>
      There is no single answer: MKSAP is the traditional standard and bundles a full text review
      for ACP members, UWorld has the newest interface and the largest confirmed question count,
      AMBOSS bundles a library and practice exams, and TrueLearn and BoardVitals offer lower-cost
      options with pass guarantees. MedPrep Institute adds adaptive weak-area review on top of any
      primary bank.
    </p>
    <h3>Is MKSAP worth it if I am not an ACP member?</h3>
    <p>
      Compare the cost of ACP membership plus the member rate against the nonmember price ($849
      for 1 year) before deciding. For many residents, membership plus the member rate works out
      cheaper than paying the nonmember price directly.
    </p>
    <h3>Do I need a question bank with a pass guarantee?</h3>
    <p>
      A guarantee is not required to pass, but TrueLearn and BoardVitals both offer one on their
      standard plans at a lower price than UWorld or MKSAP&rsquo;s nonmember rate, which can be
      worth the peace of mind if budget allows.
    </p>
    <h3>Can I use more than one ABIM question bank?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, and many residents do: a primary comprehensive resource like MKSAP or UWorld, plus a
      second bank or MedPrep&rsquo;s adaptive review for additional weak-area practice. Use the
      second resource to find topics to revisit, not purely to raise your total question count.
    </p>
    <h3>How is this different from the ABIM study guide?</h3>
    <p>
      Our <Link href="/blog/abim-study-guide">ABIM study guide</Link> covers when to start, a
      sample schedule for your final year, and general exam-prep strategy. This guide is the
      question-bank comparison specifically: verified prices, question counts, and which plan to
      buy from each provider.
