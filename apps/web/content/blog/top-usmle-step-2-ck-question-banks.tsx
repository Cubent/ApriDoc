          Each MedPrep topic produces a full clinical vignette when you reach it, so its figure is
          not directly comparable to a fixed, pre-written bank. UWorld Step 2 CK plans and
          self-assessments match the Step 1 plans: none on the 30-day plan, 1 on 90 days, 2 on 180
          days and 3 on 360 and 730 days.
        </>
      }
    />

    <H2 section={S.uworld} />
    <p>
      UWorld&rsquo;s 4,250+ question Step 2 CK bank is the default choice for most students moving
      through clerkship year, for the same reason it leads Step 1: large volume, official
      self-assessments, and explanations written in the same clinical-vignette voice as the real
      exam.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths for Step 2 CK</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4,250+ questions, the largest confirmed pre-written Step 2 CK bank in this comparison.</li>
      <li>Official self-assessments on longer plans, the closest thing to a real predictor of your Step 2 CK score, which matters more here since Step 2 CK is still numerically scored.</li>
      <li>Clinical management vignettes that mirror the real exam&rsquo;s format and reasoning style.</li>
      <li>An optional QBank Plus tier that adds medical videos for an extra $99.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Drawbacks for Step 2 CK</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The highest prices among banks with published pricing: $459 for 90 days, against AMBOSS&rsquo;s $378 for six months.</li>
      <li>The 30-day plan includes zero self-assessments.</li>
      <li>No confirmed free trial on the official page we checked.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Which plan to buy for Step 2 CK</h3>
    <p>
      The same logic as Step 1 applies: UWorld sells extra self-assessment forms separately for
      $50 each with two weeks of access. A 30-day plan ($349) plus one form ($50) comes to $399,
      close to the 90-day plan&rsquo;s $459 but with 60 fewer days of access. Since Step 2 CK
      self-assessments matter more for gauging your actual score, most students on a standard
      dedicated period find the 90-day plan the better value for the built-in form alone.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.amboss} />
    <p>
      AMBOSS bundles its Step 2 CK questions with the same clinical library, study plans and score
      predictor it offers for Step 1, which is useful since clerkship year is when you are
      learning clinical medicine and answering questions about it at the same time.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths for Step 2 CK</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5,800+ Step questions across the whole Qbank, the largest published count here.</li>
      <li>A library you can jump into from a missed question without leaving the app, useful mid-clerkship.</li>
      <li>A score predictor included on every plan.</li>
      <li>A confirmed 5-day free trial and 30-day money-back guarantee on direct purchases.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Drawbacks for Step 2 CK</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The published question count covers the whole Qbank, not a Step 2 CK-specific figure.</li>
      <li>No official self-assessment forms confirmed on the page we checked, unlike UWorld.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Which plan to buy for Step 2 CK</h3>
    <p>
      The 6-month plan ($378) fits a typical run from mid-clerkships through a Step 2 CK dedicated
      period. If you are also carrying Step 1 progress in AMBOSS, the Student Life plan ($1,199,
      through the end of PGY-1) can be cheaper per month than renewing annually, but only if you
      will keep using it that long.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.truelearn} />
    <p>
      TrueLearn covers Step 2 CK and shelf exams in the same 4,100+ question bank, which is its
      main advantage during clerkship year, when shelf exams and Step 2 CK prep overlap heavily.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths for Step 2 CK</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4,100+ combined Step 2 CK and shelf exam questions in one subscription.</li>
      <li>A first-time pass guarantee listed on its page.</li>
      <li>Performance analytics with national benchmarking.</li>
      <li>
        A Step 1 + Step 2 CK Mastery Bundle (365 days each) at $999, useful if you want both exams
        covered in one purchase.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Drawbacks for Step 2 CK</h3>
    <Callout title="Honest gap in what we could verify" tone="disclosure">
      <p>
        TrueLearn&rsquo;s Step 2 CK plan prices were not listed on the page we checked, and we
        could not confirm whether the free-trial terms that apply to Step 1 also apply to Step 2
        CK. Confirm current Step 2 CK pricing directly on TrueLearn&rsquo;s site before buying.
      </p>
    </Callout>
    <h3>Which plan to buy for Step 2 CK</h3>
    <p>
      If you are doing Step 1 and Step 2 CK back to back, the $999 Mastery Bundle is worth pricing
      against buying two separate single-exam plans at whatever Step 2 CK is currently charging.
      If you only need Step 2 CK, confirm the standalone price on TrueLearn&rsquo;s site first.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.boardvitals} />
    <p>
      We could not load a Step 2 CK product page on BoardVitals&rsquo; site to confirm details, so
      unlike our Step 1 and Step 3 deep dives, we have nothing verified to report for BoardVitals
      here.
    </p>
    <Callout title="What this means for you" tone="disclosure">
      <p>
        BoardVitals sells Step 1 and Step 3 Qbanks with published tiers and a 100% pass guarantee
        on longer plans, so a Step 2 CK product may well exist. Check{' '}
        <External href="https://www.boardvitals.com/">boardvitals.com</External> directly, since
        we are not going to guess at pricing or question counts we could not load ourselves.
      </p>
    </Callout>

    <H2 section={S.lecturio} />
    <p>
      Lecturio pairs a question bank with a full video library for Step 1, but its page did not
      confirm a dedicated Step 2 CK product in the same way.
    </p>
    <h3>What we could confirm</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A 7-day free trial is listed on Lecturio&rsquo;s site generally.</li>
      <li>Its question counts and pricing for Step 2 CK specifically were not confirmed on the page we checked.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If Step 2 CK coverage matters to you, verify directly with Lecturio before subscribing,
      since we found stronger, directly confirmed Step 2 CK offerings from UWorld, AMBOSS and
      TrueLearn.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.usmlerx} />
    <p>
      USMLE-Rx&rsquo;s Qmax covers Step 1 and Step 2 CK in the same 12-month, $299 plan, with
      explanations tied to First Aid page numbers, which is most useful if First Aid is already
      part of your review for both exams.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths for Step 2 CK</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5,000+ questions shared across Step 1 and Step 2 CK in one plan.</li>
      <li>Three self-assessments included.</li>
      <li>A 5-day free trial with no card required.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Drawbacks for Step 2 CK</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Only one plan length (12 months) is published, with no shorter option for a compressed Step 2 CK-only timeline.</li>
      <li>Less useful if you are not already using First Aid as a reference during clerkships.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Which plan to buy for Step 2 CK</h3>
    <p>
      There is only one published plan. It makes the most sense as a single purchase if you start
      it early enough in Step 1 prep that the same 12 months still covers your Step 2 CK dedicated
      period later.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.kaplan} />
    <p>
      Kaplan sells a Step 2 CK Qbank with free sample questions, marketed around UpToDate-style
      clinical content. Its pricing pages returned an access error every time we tried to load
      them directly, so we are not repeating a number we could not verify ourselves. Check{' '}

      MedPrep Institute is the question bank we build. Instead of a static set of Step 2 CK
      vignettes you work through once, an adaptive engine flags the concept behind every question
      you miss and brings you variations on it through spaced repetition over the following days.
      If you already used MedPrep for Step 1, your progress carries over automatically.
    </p>
    <h3>What you get for Step 2 CK</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>NBME-style clinical management vignettes across every core clerkship: internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, OB/GYN, psychiatry and family medicine.</li>
      <li>An adaptive engine that targets your weak rotations instead of moving on after one attempt.</li>
      <li>Built-in spaced repetition, so a missed concept comes back on a schedule.</li>
      <li>Physician-reviewed explanations.</li>
      <li>{MEDPREP_STEP2_TOPICS} Step 2 CK question topics, each producing a full clinical vignette when you reach it.</li>

    <h3>Who it suits for Step 2 CK, and where to add something</h3>
    <p>
      MedPrep suits students who keep missing the same concepts across rotations and want reviews
      scheduled for them automatically. It does not include official-style self-assessment exams
      or a score predictor. Pair it with UWorld&rsquo;s self-assessments or the official NBME
      self-assessments for that piece.

        repetition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>You are using First Aid alongside clerkships:</strong> USMLE-Rx&rsquo;s Qmax,

      <li>
        <strong>You keep missing the same concepts across rotations:</strong> add MedPrep&rsquo;s

    </ul>

    <H2 section={S.perDay} />
    <p>
      During clerkships, a small daily set tied to whatever rotation you are currently on works
      best, since it reinforces what you are seeing on the wards instead of pulling in material
      from a rotation you have not started. During a dedicated period, many students move to two
      or three full blocks a day. Because Step 2 CK still reports a three-digit score, pacing
      yourself against realistic block timing matters more here than it does for the now
      pass/fail Step 1.
    </p>
    <Callout title="Review time matters more than volume" tone="disclosure">
      <p>
        Reading every explanation, including for questions you got right, is where most of the
        actual learning happens. A smaller daily set reviewed thoroughly consistently beats a
        larger one rushed through without reading why each wrong answer is wrong.
      </p>
    </Callout>

    <H2 section={S.start} />
    <p>
      The biggest lever for Step 2 CK is starting a question bank during clerkships, not only
      afterward, so internal medicine questions get done during your internal medicine block,
      surgery during surgery, and so on. That reinforces the clinical experience and the question
      practice together, in a way that is difficult to replicate once clerkships end. Save
      official self-assessments for your final two to three weeks, when a score actually predicts
      where you will land.

      <li>Do questions during the matching clerkship, not only during a later dedicated period.</li>
      <li>Read every explanation, including for questions you answered correctly by guessing.</li>
      <li>Track misses by concept, not by question, so patterns stand out across rotations.</li>
      <li>Let missed concepts come back on a schedule instead of only once. Spaced repetition does this for you automatically.</li>
      <li>Move to timed, mixed blocks as your exam date gets closer, since the real exam does not tell you which clerkship a question is testing.</li>
      <li>Save self-assessments for your final two to three weeks, to get an honest, timed read on where you stand.</li>

    <h3>What is the single best question bank for USMLE Step 2 CK?</h3>
    <p>
      UWorld is the most widely used Step 2 CK bank, with 4,250+ pre-written questions and up to
      three official self-assessments on longer plans. AMBOSS is the main alternative if you want
      a library and score predictor in the same subscription, TrueLearn is the strongest choice if
      you want shelf-exam overlap, and MedPrep Institute adds adaptive weak-area review on top of
      any primary bank.
    </p>
    <h3>Is UWorld worth the price for Step 2 CK?</h3>
    <p>
      For most students in dedicated study, yes, especially since Step 2 CK is still numerically
      scored and UWorld&rsquo;s self-assessments are a real predictor of that score. If your
      budget is tighter, AMBOSS at $378 for six months covers similar question volume with
      different bundled extras.
    </p>
    <h3>Should I start a Step 2 CK bank during clerkships or wait for dedicated study?</h3>
    <p>
      Start during clerkships. Doing questions that match your current rotation reinforces what
      you are learning clinically at the same time, and most banks, including UWorld, AMBOSS and
      MedPrep, carry your progress forward into a later dedicated period rather than resetting it.
    </p>
    <h3>Can I use the same question bank account for Step 1 and Step 2 CK?</h3>
    <p>
      With UWorld, AMBOSS, TrueLearn and MedPrep Institute, yes, and your prior progress carries
      forward. USMLE-Rx&rsquo;s Qmax is built specifically as a single Step 1 and Step 2 CK plan
      from the start.
    </p>
    <h3>How is this different from the general USMLE question bank comparison?</h3>
    <p>
      Our <Link href="/blog/best-usmle-question-banks">general comparison</Link> covers Step 1,
      Step 2 CK and Step 3 side by side using the same verified pricing data. This guide is the
      Step 2 CK-only version, with a full strengths, drawbacks and which-plan-to-buy breakdown for
      each bank, including the gaps we could not verify for a couple of them.
    </p>
    <h3>What about Step 1 question banks?</h3>
    <p>
      See our{' '}
      <Link href="/blog/top-usmle-step-1-question-banks">Step 1 question bank comparison</Link>{' '}
      for the same depth of breakdown, applied to preclinical prep.
