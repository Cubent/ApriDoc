    <p>
      &ldquo;Syllabus&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the official term, but it&rsquo;s what most students mean
      when they ask what Step 1 actually covers. The real document is the USMLE Step 1 Content
      Outline, published directly by the NBME and FSMB, and it breaks the exam down three
      different ways at once: by organ system, by discipline, and by physician task. This guide
      walks through all three, with the exact percentage ranges from the official outline.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.whatItIs} />
    <p>
      Every Step 1 question is tagged along three separate axes simultaneously: a <strong>system</strong>{' '}
      (which organ system or process the question is about), a <strong>discipline</strong> (which
      basic science field it draws on), and a <strong>physician task</strong> (what kind of
      reasoning it&rsquo;s testing). A single cardiology question about a drug&rsquo;s mechanism
      could count toward the cardiovascular system, pharmacology as a discipline, and medical
      knowledge as a task, all at once.
    </p>
    <Callout title="The percentages in each table do not need to add up with each other" tone="disclosure">
      <p>
        Systems sum to roughly 100% on their own, disciplines sum to roughly 100% on their own, and
        physician tasks sum to roughly 100% on their own, because they are three separate ways of
        slicing the same question pool, not three different question pools. Do not try to add a
        system percentage to a discipline percentage.
      </p>
    </Callout>

    <H2 section={S.systems} />
    <p>
      The system breakdown tells you which organ systems and processes get the most questions,
      regardless of what discipline the question is drawing from.

    <H2 section={S.meaning} />
    <p>
      Three things stand out once you see the actual numbers instead of guessing at them.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Pathology and Physiology dominate the discipline axis.</strong> At 45 to 55% and 30
        to 40% respectively, these two disciplines alone can account for the reasoning behind most
        questions on the exam, regardless of which organ system they are attached to. If your
        review time is limited, these are the two disciplines where depth matters most.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No single organ system dominates the way Pathology dominates disciplines.</strong>{' '}
        The highest system category, Reproductive &amp; Endocrine, tops out at 16%, and the spread
        across systems is much flatter than the spread across disciplines. Skipping an entire
        organ system is a riskier bet than skipping depth in a smaller discipline like Genetics.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Most of the exam is still foundational science, not management.</strong> Even
        though Step 1 is written entirely as clinical vignettes, 60 to 70% of it is classified as
        applying foundational science concepts, not diagnosis or patient management. The vignette
        format tests how you apply basic science, not how you run a clinic.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you want a week-by-week plan that actually reflects this weighting, our{' '}
      <Link href="/blog/usmle-step-1-study-guide">Step 1 study guide</Link> includes a sample
      dedicated-period schedule, and our{' '}
      <Link href="/blog/8-things-to-know-usmle-step-1">8 things to know about Step 1</Link> covers
      the exam&rsquo;s rules and policies that the content outline does not.

    <H2 section={S.faq} />
    <h3>Is "content outline" the same thing as "syllabus"?</h3>
    <p>
      Close enough for practical purposes. USMLE&rsquo;s own term is the Content Outline and
      Specifications, published by the NBME and FSMB. Most students just call it the syllabus or
      the blueprint.
    </p>
    <h3>Why do the percentages in different tables not add up to 100% together?</h3>
    <p>
      Because systems, disciplines and physician tasks are three separate, overlapping ways of
      classifying the same set of questions, not three different sets of questions. Each table
      sums to roughly 100% on its own.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the single most heavily tested discipline on Step 1?</h3>
    <p>
      Pathology, at 45 to 55% of the exam, by a wide margin over every other discipline on the
      official outline.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the single most heavily tested organ system on Step 1?</h3>
    <p>
      Reproductive &amp; Endocrine Systems, at 12 to 16%, though the spread across systems is much
      flatter than the spread across disciplines, so no single system dominates the way Pathology
      does.
    </p>
    <h3>What about the Step 2 CK syllabus?</h3>
    <p>
      See our <Link href="/blog/usmle-step-2-ck-syllabus">Step 2 CK syllabus guide</Link> for the
      same breakdown applied to Step 2 CK, which replaces Step 1&rsquo;s discipline axis with a
      clinical science axis organized by rotation.
    </p>
    <h3>What about the Step 3 syllabus?</h3>
    <p>
      See our <Link href="/blog/usmle-step-3-syllabus">Step 3 syllabus guide</Link> for the same
      breakdown applied to Step 3, which drops the discipline axis entirely and shifts heavily
      toward diagnosis and management instead of foundational science.
    </p>
    <h3>Does the content outline ever change?</h3>
    <p>
      The NBME and FSMB can update it, so treat the figures here as a snapshot and confirm the
      current outline directly on USMLE.org before building a study plan around exact percentages.
